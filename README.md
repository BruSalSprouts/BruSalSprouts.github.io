# BruSalSprouts.github.io
If you are reading this, hello! This is primarily meant for the creator (Bruno / BruSal) to read, in case something happens and he forgets 
anything about this blog or whatnot. 

This blog serves as a way for myself to rant about whatever it is I feel like talking about.
That's mostly it.
I hope to go from just text to working with images and having more options than only clicking between different links.

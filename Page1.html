        <h1>This is the first page that will be published.</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the rough birth of a new blog. A blog that will cover <br>
           a wide variety of topics about whatever it is I feel like talking about.</p>
        
        <h2>I believe that an introduction of sorts is in order</h2>
        <p><em>Note that at the time of writing, it is October 10, 2020</em></p>
        <p>My name is Bruno, online I go as BruSal, often times with a "Sprouts" afterwards.<br>
           I am an 21 year old male, with my birthday being on October 30, the day before Halloween <br>
           At the time of writing this post, I am currently a sophomore at Washington State University.<br>
           Some of my hobbies include playing video games, writing stories and poetry, and learning new tech techniques and skills
        </p>
        <p>The reason I started this blog was because my father challenged me with making a blog. <br>
           I accepted the challenge, procrastinated a bit, and here we are today. 
           If you have any expectations of what will be said next, then you should probably drop them, <br>
           as I can be unpredictable over what topic will come next.</p>
        <p>I suppose that if you are now reading this, it is likely that are there already are other pages that<br>
           exist before this one, and you decided to read this one page to see what is in it, as you have an <br>
           interest in what I have to say, which is great!</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for reading this short beginning page, and I hope you will look forward to what I write in the future.</p>

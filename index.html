        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a junior at Washington State University who's majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Math, and is a part of
            the school's Honors College. I work best with C/C++, but I am able to learn and adapt to other languages as needed.
            My strenghts include organizing code, problem analysis, and being a good team player. I am an optimistic and practical
            person who is willing to learn, and I am looking for an internship that will help me grow.

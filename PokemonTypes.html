  <head> Small Web Application for Pokémon Types</head>
  <body>
    <p> AKA My first time making something that can be used from a website </p>
    <p> Since I haven't ever really made a web application, why not start small with something like a pokémon type assist? <br>
        You select a type and it tells you what moves are super effective against that type and what moves are weak against that type <br>
        It's pretty simple really </p>
    <h2> Under construction until the actual application itself is able to be put on here </h2>
